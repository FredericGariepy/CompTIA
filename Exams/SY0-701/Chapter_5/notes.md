## WAVES
- Baseband radio signals include frequencies that are very near zero. They are typically used when transferring data over a cable rather than over the air.
- 5G, Narrowband, and Zigbee are primarily used for wireless communications.
- Narrow-band typically refers to a signal that has a very narrow frequency range. This type of signal is commonly used in two-way radio systems, such as walkie-talkies


- Zigbee is used for smaller networks and supports strong security, including data encryption.
- Zigbee is a suite of communication protocols designed for smaller networks such as home automation. It has a low data rate and low power consumption, promising a battery life of two years or more. It also supports strong security, including data encryption.


## Cloud 
A community cloud is a type of cloud deployment model where the infrastructure is shared by several organizations from a specific community with shared concerns, for example shared goals, security requirements, or compliance considerations. This cloud model allows these organizations to share resources.



## SEAndroid and SELinux
SEAndroid security:
- Uses SELinux to enforce access security.
- SELinux supports two modes: Enforcing mode and Permissive mode.
- When enabled, SELinux operates using a default allowance principle.



## hardware

A System on a Chip (SoC) is essentially an integrated circuit that contains the entire functionality of a computing system within the hardware. It often has an application housed within its onboard memory, which can be any amongst ROM, EEPROM, or flash memory. In several instances, mobile computing devices come pre-installed with a SoC

## Questions/Answers (may need research)


Which of the following is a key function of a next-generation Secure Web Gateway (SWG)?
- Filters URLs and scans for malware
A next-generation Secure Web Gateway (SWG) provides proxy services for traffic from clients to Internet sites, such as filtering URLs and scanning for malware. This is a key function aimed at enhancing web security in a network.



What is the difference between the function of FPGA and Arduino in terms of configurability?
A. FPGA can change its function with the memory chip while Arduino requires a new firmware upgrade.
 FPGA can alter its function each time it is powered on due to its programmable nature, this is achieved by re-configuring the programme stored on the non-volatile memory chip. On the other hand, Arduino, which uses firmware instead of an operating system, must undergo a firmware upgrade in order to adjust its operations. Arduino is often employed for predictable, repetitive tasks.


Embedded systems does not use an operating system, but uses firmware for functionality?
- Arduino is a microcontroller board that does not need an operating system to run, but it uses firmware. It performs simple repetitive tasks, whilst the other choices like FPGA, MFP, and Raspberry Pi use operating systems to function




What is a primary benefit of utilizing an off-premises cloud service provider (CSP) solution?
[O] MORE of a BENEFIT than [X]

[O] CSP performs the maintenance and ensures the hardware is operational
>>
[X] The organization knows exactly where data is stored


What is the primary reason for an organization to potentially block the ability to switch carriers on a COPE device?
To reduce the risk of the device connecting to a untrusted network.
Allowing employees to switch carriers can potentially expose the device to untrusted networks that have poor security controls. These untrusted networks can potentially introduce vulnerabilities or threats to the device and the business data that it holds.



Which of the following defines the ’Enforcing mode’ in the context of Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) used by the security-enhanced Android (SEAndroid) security model?
 It is a mode where the SELinux policy is enforced and all activities denied by policy are blocked and logged.


What is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?
A hardware chip on the computer’s motherboard that stores cryptographic keys used for encryption.

Which of the following is a method to distribute updated version of firmware on Android devices?
Over-the-air (OTA) updates are used for updating the operating system, or firmware, of mobile devices. They are typically distributed by the device’s manufacturer or operating system provider.


What are the limitations of mobile devices when it comes to the use of passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) in the context of Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems?
Some mobile devices only support PINs, while others support either passwords or PINs
 As per the text, while MDM systems commonly support the use of passwords or PINs, the limitation comes in the nature of the mobile devices themselves. Some mobile devices only allow the use of PINs, while others have the capacity to use either passwords or PINs.




What is a common use of an Industrial Control System (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) in the manufacturing and industrial sector?
 In the context of manufacturing and industrial applications, ICS and SCADA are commonly used to monitor each stage of the manufacturing process, reporting anomalies in real time and often adjusting the processes based on changes in the environment.
