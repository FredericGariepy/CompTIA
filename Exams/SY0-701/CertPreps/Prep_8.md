This type of monitoring minimizes the impact on system performance and reduces maintenance overhead, as it does not require the installation and upkeep of agents on individual systems. Agentless monitoring provides sufficient oversight for a smaller environment without the complexity and resource demands associated with agent-based solutions. \
