### Agentless monitoring
It monitors systems and devices using standard protocols like SNMP, WMI, NetFlow, sFlow, or packet sniffing without requiring agents to be installed on the target systems.

This type of monitoring minimizes the impact on system performance and reduces maintenance overhead, as it does not require the installation and upkeep of agents on individual systems. Agentless monitoring provides sufficient oversight for a smaller environment without the complexity and resource demands associated with agent-based solutions.

### Data tokenization
Data tokenization is a process that replaces sensitive data with a token, which is a unique, non-sensitive string of characters.

### Platform diversity
In the context of **an enterprise with a homogeneous network environment, the most effective strategy** to improve resilience against specific threats targeting their current platform **is to diversify the platforms used across different departments**. \
Platform diversity involves using a variety of operating systems, software, and hardware, which reduces the risk of widespread impact from vulnerabilities or attacks that specifically target a single platform. 

### [What Is Sender Policy Framework (SPF)?](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spf)
In email cybersecurity, SPF enables the receiving mail server to check whether incoming email comes from a domain authorized by that domainâ€™s administrators.

### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a technique that is used to increase the difficulty of performing a buffer overflow attack that requires the attacker to know the location of an executable in memory.

### [What Is A Transparent Proxy?](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/transparent-proxy)
Proxy servers essentially act as a middleman between you and the internet.
- **Transparent Proxies** are useful for monitoring, filtering, and caching without requiring user interaction, often used by organizations for network management. 
- **Non-Transparent Proxies** are used for privacy(The proxy hides your real IP addres), security, and bypassing content restrictions, where the user is aware and in control of the proxy configuration.

Proxy uses:

- Firefox: Menu>Settings>Network Settings>Settings>Manual proxy configuration
- Tor Network
- Curl 
```bash
curl -x http://proxy_ip:proxy_port http://example.com
```

- Python Requests / Web Scraping
```python
# SOCKS4: Older version, supports only TCP traffic (works for web browsing, emails, etc.).
# SOCKS5: Newer version, supports both TCP and UDP traffic, allows for more features like authentication and better security options.

import requests

proxies = {
    "http": "socks5://proxy_ip:proxy_port",
    "https": "socks5://proxy_ip:proxy_port"
    "http": "http://proxy_ip:proxy_port",
    "https": "https://proxy_ip:proxy_port",
}

response = requests.get("http://example.com", proxies=proxies)
print(response.text)
```
