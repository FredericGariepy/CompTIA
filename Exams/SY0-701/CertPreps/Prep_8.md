### Agentless monitoring
It monitors systems and devices using standard protocols like SNMP, WMI, NetFlow, sFlow, or packet sniffing without requiring agents to be installed on the target systems.

This type of monitoring minimizes the impact on system performance and reduces maintenance overhead, as it does not require the installation and upkeep of agents on individual systems. Agentless monitoring provides sufficient oversight for a smaller environment without the complexity and resource demands associated with agent-based solutions. \

### Data tokenization
Data tokenization is a process that replaces sensitive data with a token, which is a unique, non-sensitive string of characters.

### Platform diversity
In the context of **an enterprise with a homogeneous network environment, the most effective strategy** to improve resilience against specific threats targeting their current platform **is to diversify the platforms used across different departments**. \
Platform diversity involves using a variety of operating systems, software, and hardware, which reduces the risk of widespread impact from vulnerabilities or attacks that specifically target a single platform.

In email cybersecurity, SPF enables the receiving mail server to check whether incoming email comes from a domain authorized by that domainâ€™s administrators.

### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a technique that is used to increase the difficulty of performing a buffer overflow attack that requires the attacker to know the location of an executable in memory.
