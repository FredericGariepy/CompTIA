[IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)

While ports are generally well-defined and assigned to specific services, \
they are not fixed and can be changed. \
Especially in cybersecurity contexts.

There are 0 to 65535 (2^16) possible ports \
The port numbers are divided into three ranges: 
- System Ports 0 - 1023
- User Ports 1024 - 49151
- Dynamic and/or Private Ports 49152 - 65535
