### Vulnerability and Patch Management
Although patch management is an important aspect of any information security program, like signature-based anti-malware detection, it is an endless race against time that offers no protection against zero-day exploits.

### Configuration Management
Formal process used by organizations to define and maintain standard configurations for applications, devices, and systems throughout their lifecycle. \
e.g.:
- particular desktop PC model may be configured by an organization with specific security settings, such as enabling whole disk encryption and disabling USB ports.
- Within the desktop operating system, security settings such as disabling unneeded and risky services (for example, FTP and Telnet) may be configured.
